            <a href="https://www.iamaneh.ch/en/">IAMANEH</a> (International
            Association for Maternal and Neonatal Health) was founded in 1978
            by the Swiss Gynecologist Hubert de Watteville and is a ZEWO
            certified charity. It focuses on the physical, social and
            psychological well-being of women and children in Mali, Senegal,
            Togo, Burkina Faso, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania. The "Token of
            Gratitude" community fundraiser supports a 3-year project
            (2016-2019) in Burkina Faso, which IAMANEH have implemented in
            collaboration with their local partner AMMIE (Association pour
            l'Appui Moral, Matériel et Intellectuel de l'Enfant). Their focus
            is to provide young women with information and access to reliable
            means of family planning. Teenage pregnancies are often the start
            of a vicious circle, leading to family rejection, early school
            leaving, and eventually to prostitution and other dependencies.
            In cooperation with AMMIE, IAMANEH provides schooling for
            “peer-educators”, enabling more than 100 young women and men
            to engage with their local communities about issues related
            to family planning. They also run health centers, helping young women
            to access information, support and contraceptive means.
            Additionally, IAMANEH supports young women with children in
            building up their own source of income, such as a sewing or barber
            shop, helping them to achieve financial independence.

                  As part of our commitment to equal opportunities for
                  everyone, Trust Square together with Procivis and FDP. The
                  Liberal Women Switzerland launched a community fundraiser to
                  benefit young women in Ouahigouya, Burkina Faso. For this
                  purpose, we have built a charity smart contract called "Token
                  of Gratitude", based on which individuals can contribute to
                  the project by donating Ether. In return, the smart contract
                  will issue a token to the contributor's wallet, serving as a
                  "donation certificate". Attached to the token there is a
                  virtual flower, created randomly for each donor. The flower
                  can be viewed via the "view donation" function on this
                  website.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The smart contract will run for a total of 8 weeks (until
                  August 7, 2018) during which it will allocate all
                  contributions to the wallet of the charity. You can find the
                  repository of the smart contract <a href="https://github.com/Polynom/CryptoFlowers" target="_blank">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  We believe that fundraising via public ledger can greatly
                  increase transparency and reduce administrative costs for
                  charitable giving. We are very happy that the Swiss charity
                  IAMANEH agreed to collaborate with us to accept donations
                  denominated in Ether.
